# react-typescript-node-udemy-course-with-stephen-grider
This repo contains my work and learning notes which I made whilst taking the course named "React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project" by Stephen Grider which is hosted in Udemy. The intention in taking this course is to consolidate my existing understanding of React with Typescript and Node.js into a project/projects.
